## Printing

Printing the tables is a bit crazy.  There is something odd about how Bootstrap renders the layout when it is set to 'landscape'. It seems that it has the "wrong" breakpoints for the columns.  This can be fixed by tweaking the "scale" when printing.  Simply decrease the scale value incrementally and you'll see the columns "line-up".
